## Installing Cargo

Cargo is distributed by default with Rust, so if you've got `rustc` installed
locally you probably also have `cargo` installed locally.

## Compiling from Source

Cargo requires the following tools and packages to build:

* `python`
* `curl` (on Unix)
* `cmake`
* OpenSSL headers (only for Unix, this is the `libssl-dev` package on ubuntu)
* `cargo` and `rustc`

First, you'll want to check out this repository

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo
cd cargo
```

With `cargo` already installed, you can simply run:

```
cargo build --release
```

Otherwise, you can also use a more traditional approach:

```sh
./configure
make
make install
```

More options can be discovered through `./configure`, such as compiling cargo
for more than one target. For example, if you'd like to compile both 32 and 64
bit versions of cargo on unix you would use:

```
$ ./configure --target=i686-unknown-linux-gnu,x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

## Running the tests

To run cargo's tests, use `cargo test`. If you do not have the cross-compilers
installed locally, ignore the cross-compile test failures, or disable them by
using `CFG_DISABLE_CROSS_TESTS=1 cargo test`.

## Adding new subcommands to Cargo

Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Cargo itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and
a list of known community-developed subcommands.

## Contributing to the Docs

To contribute to the docs, all you need to do is change the markdown files in
the `src/doc` directory. To view the rendered version of changes you have
made locally, run:

```sh
./configure
make doc
open target/doc/index.html
```

## Releases

High level release notes are available as part of [Rust's release notes][rel].
Cargo releases coincide with Rust releases.
